# Water Polo Database

This project was the final assignment of CSE 111 (Database Systems) at UC Merced during the Fall 2019 Semester. The goal was to create a populated database consisting of data from a hypothetical national Water Polo league. In addition, we created a simple command line script that allows for several use cases. The exact assignment specifications can be viewed [here](Requirements.pdf).
